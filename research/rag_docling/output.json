In con- trast , for many traditional philosophies and religions , such as Buddhism , the key to happiness is to know the truth about yourself - to understand who , or what , you really are . Most people wrongly identify themselves with their feelings , thoughts , likes and dislikes . When they feel anger , they think , ' I am angry . This is my anger . ' They consequently spend their life avoiding some kinds of feelings and pursuing others . They never realise that they are not their feel- ings , and that the relentless pursuit of particular feelings just traps them in misery . If this is so , then our entire understanding of the history of hap- piness might be misguided . Maybe it isn't so important whether people's expectations are fulfilled and whether they enjoy pleasant feelings . The main question is whether people know the truth about themselves . What evidence do we have that people today understand this truth any better than ancient foragers or medieval peasants ? Scholars began to study the history of happiness only a few years ago , and we are still formulating initial hypotheses and searching for appropriate research methods . It's much too early to adopt rigid con- clusions and end a debate that's hardly yet begun . What is important is to get to know as many different approaches as possible and to ask the right questions . Most history books focus on the ideas of great thinkers , the brav- ery of warriors , the charity of saints and the creativity of artists . They have much to tell about the weaving and unravelling of social struc- tures , about the rise and fall of empires , about the discovery and spread of technologies . Yet they say nothing about how all this influ- enced the happiness and suffering of individuals . This is the biggest lacuna in our understanding of history . We had better start filling it .",

Sapiens are subject to the same physical forces , chemical reactions and natural - selection processes that govern all living beings . Natural selection may have provided Homo sapiens with a much larger play- ing field than it has given to any other organism , but the field has still had its boundaries . The implication has been that , no matter what their efforts and achievements , Sapiens are incapable of break- ing free of their biologically determined limits . But as the twenty - first century unfolds , this is no longer true : Homo sapiens is transcending those limits . It is now beginning to break the laws of natural selection , replacing them with the laws of intelligent design . For close to 4 billion years , every single organism on the planet evolved subject to natural selection . Not even one was designed by an intelligent creator . The giraffe , for example , got its long neck thanks to competition between archaic giraffes rather than to the whims of a super - intelligent being . Proto - giraffes who had longer necks had access to more food and consequently produced more offspring than did those with shorter necks . Nobody , certainly not the giraffes , said , ' A long neck would enable giraffes to munch leaves off the treetops . Let's extend it . ' The beauty of Darwin's theory is that it does not need to assume an intelligent designer to explain how giraffes ended up with long necks . For billions of years , intelligent design was not even an option , because there was no intelligence which could design things .",

          "text": "Microorganisms , which until quite recently were the only liv- ing things around , are capable of amazing feats . A microorganism belonging to one species can incorporate genetic codes from a com- pletely different species into its cell and thereby gain new capabilities , such as resistance to antibiotics . Yet , as best we know , microorgan- isms have no consciousness , no aims in life , and no ability to plan ahead . At some stage organisms such as giraffes , dolphins , chimpan- zees and Neanderthals evolved consciousness and the ability to plan ahead . But even if a Neanderthal fantasised about fowls so fat and slow - moving that he could just scoop them up whenever he was hungry , he had no way of turning that fantasy into reality . He had to hunt the birds that had been naturally selected . The first crack in the old regime appeared about 10,000 years ago , during the Agricultural Revolution . Sapiens who dreamed of fat , slow - moving chickens discovered that if they mated the fattest hen with the slowest cock , some of their offspring would be both fat and slow . If you mated those offspring with each other , you could produce a line of fat , slow birds . It was a race of chickens unknown to nature , produced by the intelligent design not of a god but of a human . Still , compared to an all - powerful deity , Homo sapiens had limited design skills . Sapiens could use selective breeding to detour around and accelerate the natural - selection processes that normally affected chickens , but they could not introduce completely new character- istics that were absent from the genetic pool of wild chickens . In a way , the relationship between Homo sapiens and chickens was simi- lar to many other symbiotic relationships that have so often arisen on their own in nature . Sapiens exerted peculiar selective pressures on chickens that caused the fat and slow ones to proliferate , just as pollinating bees select flowers , causing the bright colourful ones to proliferate . Today , the 4 - billion - year - old regime of natural selection is facing a completely different challenge . In laboratories throughout the world , scientists are engineering living beings . They break the laws of natural selection with impunity , unbridled even by an organism's original characteristics . Eduardo Kac , a Brazilian bio - artist , decided in 2000 to create a new work of art : a fluorescent green rabbit . Kac",

The French scientists took a run - of - the - mill white rabbit embryo , implanted in its DNA a gene taken from a green fluorescent jellyfish , and voilà ! One green fluores- cent rabbit for le monsieur . Kac named the rabbit Alba . It is impossible to explain the existence of Alba through the laws of natural selection . She is the product of intelligent design . She is also a harbinger of things to come . If the potential Alba signi- fies is realised in full- and if humankind doesn't annihilate itself meanwhile the Scientific Revolution might prove itself far greater than a mere historical revolution . It may turn out to be the most important biological revolution since the appearance of life on earth . After 4 billion years of natural selection , Alba stands at the dawn of a new cosmic era , in which life will be ruled by intelligent design . If this happens , the whole of human history up to that point might , with hindsight , be reinterpreted as a process of experimentation and apprenticeship that revolutionised the game of life . Such a process should be understood from a cosmic perspective of billions of years , rather than from a human perspective of millennia . Biologists the world over are locked in battle with the intelligent- design movement , which opposes the teaching of Darwinian evolution in schools and claims that biological complexity proves there must be a creator who thought out all biological details in advance . The biologists are right about the past , but the proponents of intelligent design might , ironically , be right about the future . At the time of writing , the replacement of natural selection by intelligent design could happen in any of three ways : through bio- logical engineering , cyborg engineering ( cyborgs are beings that combine organic with non - organic parts ) or the engineering of in- organic life .",

People have been using it for millennia in order to reshape themselves and other organisms . A simple example is castration . Humans have been castrating bulls for perhaps 10,000 years in order to create oxen . Oxen are less aggressive , and are thus easier to train to pull ploughs . Humans also castrated their own young males to create soprano singers with enchanting voices and eunuchs who could safely be entrusted with overseeing the sultan's harem . But recent advances in our understanding of how organisms work , down to the cellular and nuclear levels , have opened up pre- viously unimaginable possibilities . For instance , we can today not merely castrate a man , but also change his sex through surgical and hormonal treatments . But that's not all .

' Even more remarkable wonders can be performed with genetic engineering , which is why it raises a host of ethical , political and ideological issues . And it's not just pious monotheists who object that man should not usurp God's role . Many confirmed atheists are no less shocked by the idea that scientists are stepping into nature's shoes . Animal - rights activists decry the suffering caused to lab ani- mals in genetic engineering experiments , and to the farmyard animals that are engineered in complete disregard of their needs and desires . Human - rights activists are afraid that genetic engineering might be used to create supermen who will make serfs of the rest of us . Jere- miahs offer apocalyptic visions of bio - dictatorships that will clone fearless soldiers and obedient workers . The prevailing feeling is that too many opportunities are opening too quickly and that our ability to modify genes is outpacing our capacity for making wise and far- sighted use of the skill . The result is that we're at present using only a fraction of the potential of genetic engineering . Most of the organisms now being engineered are those with the weakest political lobbies - plants , fungi , bacteria and insects . For example , lines of E. coli , a bacter- ium that lives symbiotically in the human gut ( and which makes headlines when it gets out of the gut and causes deadly infections ) , have been genetically engineered to produce biofuel.2 E. coli and several species of fungi have also been engineered to produce insulin , thereby lowering the cost of diabetes treatment.³ A gene extracted from an Arctic fish has been inserted into potatoes , making the plants more frost - resistant.4 A few mammals have also been subject to genetic engineering . Every year the dairy industry suffers billions of dollars in damages due to mastitis , a disease that strikes dairy - cow udders .

          "text": "What do we need Neanderthals for ? Some argue that if we could study live Neanderthals , we could answer some of the most nag- ging questions about the origins and uniqueness of Homo sapiens . By comparing a Neanderthal to a Homo sapiens brain , and mapping out where their structures differ , perhaps we could identify what bio- logical change produced consciousness as we experience it . There's an ethical reason , too – some have argued that if Homo sapiens was responsible for the extinction of the Neanderthals , it has a moral duty to resurrect them . And having some Neanderthals around might be useful . Lots of industrialists would be glad to pay one Neanderthal to do the menial work of two Sapiens . But why stop even at Neanderthals ? Why not go back to God's drawing board and design a better Sapiens ? The abilities , needs and desires of Homo sapiens have a genetic basis , and the Sapiens genome is no more complex than that of voles and mice . ( The mouse genome contains about 2.5 billion nucleobases , the Sapiens genome about 2.9 billion bases - meaning the latter is only 14 per cent larger . ) ¹¹ In the medium range - perhaps in a few decades - genetic engineer- ing and other forms of biological engineering might enable us to make far - reaching alterations not only to our physiology , immune system and life expectancy , but also to our intellectual and emotional capacities . If genetic engineering can create genius mice , why not genius humans ? If it can create monogamous voles , why not humans hard - wired to remain faithful to their partners ? The Cognitive Revolution that turned Homo sapiens from an insignificant ape into the master of the world did not require any noticeable change in physiology or even in the size and external shape of the Sapiens brain . It apparently involved no more than a few small changes to internal brain structure . Perhaps another small change would be enough to ignite a Second Cognitive Revolution , create a completely new type of consciousness , and transform Homo sapiens into something altogether different . True , we still don't have the acumen to achieve this , but there seems to be no insurmountable technical barrier preventing us from producing superhumans . The main obstacles are the ethical and political objections that have slowed down research on humans . And no matter how convincing the ethical arguments may be , it is hard",

' The devel- opers hope to identify underwater electromagnetic fields made by submarines and mines , by exploiting the natural magnetic detecting capabilities of sharks , which are superior to those of any man - made detectors.13 Sapiens , too , are being turned into cyborgs . The newest gener- ation of hearing aids are sometimes referred to as ' bionic ears ' . The device consists of an implant that absorbs sound through a micro- phone located in the outer part of the ear . The implant filters the sounds , identifies human voices , and translates them into electric signals that are sent directly to the central auditory nerve and from there to the brain . 14 Retina Implant , a government - sponsored German company , is developing a retinal prosthesis that may allow blind people to gain partial vision . It involves implanting a small microchip inside the patient's eye . Photocells absorb light falling on the eye and transform it into electrical energy , which stimulates the intact nerve cells in the retina . The nervous impulses from these cells stimulate the brain , where they are translated into sight . At present the technology allows patients to orientate themselves in space , identify letters , and even recognise faces . 15 Jesse Sullivan , an American electrician , lost both arms up to the shoulder in a 2001 accident . Today he uses two bionic arms , cour- tesy of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago . The special feature of Jesse's new arms is that they are operated by thought alone . Neural signals arriving from Jesse's brain are translated by micro - computers into electrical commands , and the arms move . When Jesse wants to raise his arm , he does what any normal person unconsciously does - and the arm rises . These arms can perform a much more limited range of movements than organic arms , but they enable Jesse to carry out simple daily functions . A similar bionic arm has recently been outfitted for Claudia Mitchell , an American soldier who lost her arm in a motorcycle accident . Scientists believe that we will soon have bionic arms that will not only move when willed to move , but",

Another rhesus monkey , Idoya , won world fame in 2008 when she thought - controlled a pair of bionic legs in Kyoto , Japan , from her North Carolina chair . The legs were twenty times Idoya's weight.17 Locked - in syndrome is a condition in which a person loses all or nearly all her ability to move any part of her body , while her cog- nitive abilities remain intact . Patients suffering from the syndrome have up till now been able to communicate with the outside world only through small eye movements . However , a few patients have had brain - signal - gathering electrodes implanted in their brains . Efforts are being made to translate such signals not merely into movements but also into words . If the experiments succeed , locked- in patients could finally speak directly with the outside world , and we might eventually be able to use the technology to read other people's minds.18 Yet of all the projects currently under development , the most revolutionary is the attempt to devise a direct two - way brain- computer interface that will allow computers to read the electrical signals of a human brain , simultaneously transmitting signals that the brain can read in turn . What if such interfaces are used to directly link a brain to the Internet , or to directly link several brains to each other , thereby creating a sort of Inter - brain - net ? What might hap- pen to human memory , human consciousness and human identity if the brain has direct access to a collective memory bank ? In such a situation , one cyborg could , for example , retrieve the memories of another - not hear about them , not read about them in an autobiog- raphy , not imagine them , but directly remember them as if they were his own . Or her own . What happens to concepts such as the self and gender identity when minds become collective ? How could you know thyself or follow your dream if the dream is not in your mind but in some collective reservoir of aspirations ? Such a cyborg would no longer be human , or even organic . It would be something completely different . It would be so funda- mentally another kind of being that we cannot even grasp the philosophical , psychological or political implications .",

The most obvious examples are computer programs and computer viruses that can undergo independent evolution . The field of genetic programming is today one of the most inter- esting spots in the computer science world . It tries to emulate the methods of genetic evolution . Many programmers dream of creating a program that could learn and evolve completely independently of its creator . In this case , the programmer would be a primum mobile , a first mover , but his creation would be free to evolve in directions neither its maker nor any other human could ever have envisaged . A prototype for such a program already exists - it's called a com- puter virus . As it spreads through the Internet , the virus replicates itself millions upon millions of times , all the while being chased by predatory antivirus programs and competing with other viruses for a place in cyberspace . One day when the virus replicates itself a mistake occurs a computerised mutation . Perhaps the mutation occurs because the human engineer programmed the virus to make occasional random replication mistakes . Perhaps the mutation was due to a random error . If , by chance , the modified virus is better at evading antivirus programs without losing its ability to invade other computers , it will spread through cyberspace . If so , the mutants will survive and reproduce . As time goes by , cyberspace would be full of new viruses that nobody engineered , and that undergo non - organic evolution . Are these living creatures ? It depends on what you mean by ' living creatures ' . They have certainly been produced by a new evolution- ary process , completely independent of the laws and limitations of organic evolution . Imagine another possibility - suppose you could back up your brain to a portable hard drive and then run it on your laptop . Would your laptop be able to think and feel just like a Sapiens ? If so , would it be you or someone else ?

The project's director has claimed that , if funded properly , within a decade or two we could have an artificial human brain inside a computer that could talk and behave very much as a human does . If successful , that would mean that after 4 billion years of milling around inside the small world of organic compounds , life will suddenly break out into the vastness of the inorganic realm , ready to take up shapes beyond our wild- est dreams . Not all scholars agree that the mind works in a manner analogous to today's digital computers - and if it doesn't , present- day computers would not be able to simulate it . Yet it would be foolish to categorically dismiss the possibility before giving it a try . In 2013 the project received a grant of er billion from the European Union.19",

The family doctor could soon tell you with greater certainty that face high risks of liver cancer , whereas you needn't worry too much about heart attacks . She could determine that a popular medication that helps 92 per cent of people is useless to you , and you should instead take another pill , fatal to many people but just right for you . The road to near - perfect medicine stands before us . However , with improvements in medical knowledge will come new ethical conundrums . Ethicists and legal experts are already wrest- ling with the thorny issue of privacy as it relates to DNA . Would insurance companies be entitled to ask for our DNA scans and to raise premiums if they discover a genetic tendency to reckless behav- iour ? Would we be required to fax our DNA , rather than our CV , to potential employers ? Could an employer favour a candidate because his DNA looks better ? Or could we sue in such cases for genetic discrimination ? Could a company that develops a new creature or a new organ register a patent on its DNA sequences ? It is obvious that one can own a particular chicken , but can one own an entire species ? Such dilemmas are dwarfed by the ethical , social and political implications of the Gilgamesh Project and of our potential new abil- ities to create superhumans . The Universal Declaration of Human Rights , government medical programmes throughout the world , national health insurance programmes and national constitutions worldwide recognise that a humane society ought to give all its members fair medical treatment and keep them in relatively good health . That was all well and good as long as medicine was chiefly concerned with preventing illness and healing the sick . What might happen once medicine becomes preoccupied with enhancing human abilities ? Would all humans be entitled to such enhanced abilities , or would there be a new superhuman elite ? Our late modern world prides itself on recognising , for the first time in history , the basic equality of all humans , yet it might be poised to create the most unequal of all societies .

Yet the story has a deeper meaning . The Frankenstein myth confronts Homo sapiens with the fact that the last days are fast approaching . Unless some nuclear or ecological catastrophe intervenes , so goes the story , the pace of technologic- al development will soon lead to the replacement of Homo sapiens by completely different beings who possess not only different phys- iques , but also very different cognitive and emotional worlds . This is something most Sapiens find extremely disconcerting . We like to believe that in the future people just like us will travel from planet to planet in fast spaceships . We don't like to contemplate the possibility that in the future , beings with emotions and identities like ours will no longer exist , and our place will be taken by alien life forms whose abilities dwarf our own . We seek comfort in the fantasy that Dr Frankenstein can create only terrible monsters , whom we would have to destroy in order to save the world . We like to tell the story that way because it implies that we are the best of all beings , that there never was and never will be something better than us . Any attempt to improve us will inevi- tably fail , because even if our bodies might be improved , you cannot touch the human spirit . We would have a hard time swallowing the fact that scientists could engineer spirits as well as bodies , and that future Dr Franken- steins could therefore create something truly superior to us , some- thing that will look at us as condescendingly as we look at the Neanderthals .",

          "text": "century , people would be living in space colonies on Mars and Pluto . Few of these forecasts came true . On the other hand , nobody fore- saw the Internet . So don't go out just yet to buy liability insurance to indemnify you against lawsuits filed by digital beings . The above fantasies - or nightmares are just stimulants for your imagination . What we should take seriously is the idea that the next stage of history will include not only technological and organisational transformations , but also fundamental transformations in human consciousness and identity . And these could be transformations so fundamental that they will call the very term ' human ' into question . How long do we have ? No one really knows . As already mentioned , some say that by 2050 a few humans will already be a - mortal . Less radical forecasts speak of the next century , or the next millennium . Yet from the per- spective of 70,000 years of Sapiens history , what are a few millennia ? If the curtain is indeed about to drop on Sapiens history , we members of one of its final generations should devote some time to answering one last question : what do we want to become ? This question , sometimes known as the Human Enhancement question , dwarfs the debates that currently preoccupy politicians , philoso- phers , scholars and ordinary people . After all , today's debate between today's religions , ideologies , nations and classes will in all likelihood disappear along with Homo sapiens . If our successors indeed func- tion on a different level of consciousness ( or perhaps possess some- thing beyond consciousness that we cannot even conceive ) , it seems doubtful that Christianity or Islam will be of interest to them , that their social organisation could be Communist or capitalist , or that their genders could be male or female . And yet the great debates of history are important because at least the first generation of these gods would be shaped by the cultural ideas of their human designers . Would they be created in the image of capitalism , of Islam , or of feminism ? The answer to this question might send them careening in entirely different directions . Most people prefer not to think about it . Even the field of bioeth- ics prefers to address another question , ' What is it forbidden to do ? \" Is it acceptable to carry out genetic experiments on living human beings ? On aborted fetuses ? On stem cells ? Is it ethical to clone sheep ?",

For these projects are inextric- ably meshed together with the Gilgamesh Project . Ask scientists why they study the genome , or try to connect a brain to a computer , or try to create a mind inside a computer . Nine out of ten times you'll get the same standard answer : we are doing it to cure diseases and save human lives . Even though the implications of creating a mind inside a computer are far more dramatic than curing psychiatric ill- nesses , this is the standard justification given , because nobody can argue with it . This is why the Gilgamesh Project is the flagship of science . It serves to justify everything science does . Dr Frankenstein piggybacks on the shoulders of Gilgamesh . Since it is impossible to stop Gilgamesh , it is also impossible to stop Dr Frankenstein . The only thing we can try to do is to influence the direction scientists are taking . But since we might soon be able to engineer our desires too , the real question facing us is not ' What do we want to become ? ' , but ' What do we want to want ?

In the following millennia it transformed itself into the master of the entire planet and the terror of the ecosystem . Today it stands on the verge of becoming a god , poised to acquire not only eternal youth , but also the divine abilities of creation and destruction . Unfortunately , the Sapiens regime on earth has so far produced little that we can be proud of . We have mastered our surroundings , increased food production , built cities , established empires and cre- ated far - flung trade networks . But did we decrease the amount of suffering in the world ? Time and again , massive increases in human power did not necessarily improve the well - being of individual Sapi- ens , and usually caused immense misery to other animals . In the last few decades we have at last made some real progress as far as the human condition is concerned , with the reduction of famine , plague and war . Yet the situation of other animals is deterior- ating more rapidly than ever before , and the improvement in the lot of humanity is too recent and fragile to be certain of . Moreover , despite the astonishing things that humans are cap- able of doing , we remain unsure of our goals and we seem to be as discontented as ever . We have advanced from canoes to galleys to steamships to space shuttles - but nobody knows where we're going .
